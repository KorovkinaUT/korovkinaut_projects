You are in one of the 20 rooms of the cave. In some of the other rooms Wampuses are sleeping.
You have a bow and arrow, to win you need to shoot all the Wampuses in the cave.
The Wampus is a large monster that feeds on humans. He is very heavy, so the giant bats (another cave dweller)
can't move him. He has suction cups on his legs, so he doesn't fall into bottomless holes.
Wampus gives off a disgusting odor, so if he's in the next room, you'll smell it.
However, Wampus has sensitive hearing, so he wakes up at the sound of a bow shot and can go to sleep in one
of the neighboring rooms.
The rooms where the noise comes from are inhabited by giant bats. If you enter such a room,
they will take you to a random room in the cave.
In the rooms where the wind blows, there are bottomless holes in which you will die.
Now more about your arrows. They are magical - they can turn and fly through up to 5 rooms connected by tunnels.
However, if you enter the wrong sequence of rooms, the arrow will end up in a random room.
And if you run out of arrows, you lose.
Before the game starts you can enter the number of Wampuses and bats in the game, but remember that
there can't be more than 19 of them.
